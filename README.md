# VehicleUP

Not fully ready to upload videos

### Full Stack Web Application.

The purpose of this project is to show the process of developing a Full Stack Web Application that uses the MVC architecture. It showcases a Vehicle Upload web app where users can save, view, update and delete vehicle videos.

- Front End
  React JavaScript web application that communicates with the Back End by performing all the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete). This application serves as the View component in the MVC model.

- Back End
  The Back End consists of two parts:

Java Spring based application that servers as the Controller component of the MVC model by accepting HTTP requests from the View component and converting them to commands for the Model, then sending data back to the View for it to display.

MySQL database that servers as the Model component of the MVC architecture by providing a dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface.

Note: This Full Stack application runs on a local device.
